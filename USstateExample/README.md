My first D3 map showing my travel across the US. This visualization was built by modifying [choropleth example code by Scott Murray](https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book/blob/master/chapter_12/05_choropleth.html), [tooltip example code by Malcolm Maclean](http://www.d3noob.org/2013/01/adding-tooltips-to-d3js-graph.html), and [legend code example by Mike Bostock](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3888852).
